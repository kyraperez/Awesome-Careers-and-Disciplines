CAREERS

-Game Design
The job of a Game Designer is to focus on the core experience of playing a game. They might help come up with specific
gameplay mechanics or level ideas that would help make the game fun and engaging for the player.

-Game Programming
The main focus of Game Programmer has to do with the coding side of making a game. This is very broad, and means that their
work helps out many different aspects of the game. Some game programmers might focus on things like graphics, while others might
do AI, UI, networking, and more.

-Game Production
Game Producers are usually the ones overseeing the process of making a game and getting it published. They help get funding and
manage budgets, while also keeping track of things like deadlines.

-Game Art
Game Artists help take the ideas of writers and bring them to life by illustrating them. They create the visuals of a game, which can
be seen through many things like Character Design, Environmental Design, Weapon Design, Enemy Design, and more.

-Game Audio Design
Game Audio Designers are behind the many different sounds that can be heard throughout a game. This can be something like character
dialouge and background music, but is also in the smaller things like footsteps, gun shots, and even menu sounds.


DISCIPLINES

-AI
AI Programmers make algorithms for NPCs and enemies so that they react in a specific way based on the actions of the players. This is 
important because it helps fix the game expierence for the player by making things seem real and reactive.

-Physics
Physics Programmers are in charge of making the game FEEL real. They make it so the player can interact with the environments and
backgrounds in a way that feels similar to real life. By mirroring the laws of physics in a game, everything can react in a way that feels
real and familiar.

-Graphics
Graphics Programmers try to make the game as visually appealing as they can. They work close with Game Artists in order to help create a game
that feels good to look at. They need to know rendering and optimisation so that they game can still run well while looking its best.

-Engine
Engine Programmers have to make the engine that is used for the game to run. Many games just choose to use Unity or Unreal, but sometimes for larger,
or very specific projects, companies get Engine Programmers to develop specific engines for their games. They help make the basis that everything else
is built off of.

-Gameplay
Gameplay Programmers have to write the code for the main aspects of the game that make it fun. This is usually things like combat, but would also go
for other things that are key to what really makes the game worth playing.
